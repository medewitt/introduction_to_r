# Introduction to R

The goal of this repository is to introduce some topics to novice R users. Sometimes the most intimidating part of anything with a command line interface is starting. So let's start with a constructive was of getting started.

## Getting R

* First step is to go to CRAN and download the base version of R for your operating system at [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

* Next download RStudio for your operating system. This can be done at [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You want the open source RStudio Desktop. It's free.

* Next install Git. Git is a version control system that also doubles down as a great way to share information and files (especially code). Atlassian has put together a nice "how-to" here [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

    * If you have a windows system go [here](https://gitforwindows.org/)
    * If you have a MAC system you should already have git. If not then go [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/)

After you have installed all of them (in that order) open up R Studio! This will be your IDE or integrated development environment. RStudio has done an amazing job with all the features and has really made R into an enterprise ready solution.

## Getting the Example Documents

The next step is pulling down these documents for use. This can be done by opening RStudio and then creating a new project

File --> New Project

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/new_project.png")
```

From there you will select the `Version Control` feature to check checkout my infomation from github.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/new_proj_version_control.png")
```

I use `Git` as my version control system so go ahead and select that option.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/project_from_git.png")
```

Now enter the following URL into the `Repository URL` field. 

https://github.com/medewitt/intro_to_r.git

Select where you would like to put this collection of documents and then hit `create project`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/intro_to_r_git.png")
```

Now we're off!
