## Introduction

Most of the workshop focused on building a hypothetical project. The project that we used is located [here](https://github.com/medewitt/r_class_demo) at this link and is updated with all of the exercises that we did in class. This is where the blank exercises exist as well as the initial phase of a "good" project structure. Additionally, below are links to the exercises that were completed during the workshops and their associated answers.
