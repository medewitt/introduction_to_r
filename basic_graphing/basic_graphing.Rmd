Base R has internal plotting/ graphing functionality

```{r fig.show='hold',fig.align='center', out.width= 400}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram")
boxplot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$gear)
```

# Base R Graphing

Base R graphics are _pretty_ good

Called pen and ink (e.g. each layer is drawn on top of the other)

Have to redraw entire graphic if you need to "go back"

# Enter `ggplot2`

.pull-left[
The `ggplot2` package is based on the _Grammar of Graphics_ by Leland Wilkinson

Grammar of Graphics proposes a philosophical underpinning for all statistical graphics

`ggplot2` is an implementation of the the grammar of graphics

# So what does it mean?

> In brief, the grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinate system. Faceting can be used to generate the same plot for different subsets of the dataset. It is the combination of these independent components that make up a graphic.

# Components of the Grammar

In the grammar of graphics there are the following components of a graphic

* **data** - what data are you trying to plot

* **mappings** - what aesthetic mapping are you trying to plot

* **layers**
  * geometries - bars, lines, points, etc
  * statistics - statistical summaries of the data (e.g. counts)
  
* **scales** - map color, size, shape

* **coordinate systems** - describe how the data are mapped

* **facets** - breaking the data into subsets of small multiples

* **themes** - the details of display like font size, color pallets, etc

---

# Components Map Directly to `ggplot` 

Each component has a function or argument in `ggplot2`

* **data** - `data`

* **mappings** - `aes(x, y, color, size, group)`

* **layers**
  * geometries - `geom_` (e.g. `geom_bar`)
  * statistics - `stat`
  
* **scales** - `scale_` (e.g.) `scale_colour_discrete`

* **coordinate systems** - `coord_polar`

* **facets** - `facet_`

* **themes** - `theme_minimal`

# So Let's Start With a Graph

The `diamonds` set is automatically loaded with `ggplot2`

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```

---
# Building the Graph with `ggplot`

```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = diamonds)

```

Now we have initiated a graphical object

---
# Now Add Our Aesthetics with `aes`

```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y= price))
```

---
# Now Add Our Layer

`geom_point` will place a dot for each x-y pair

```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y= price))+
  {{geom_point()}}
```

---
# Can manipulate features of a given `geom`

.pull-left[
`alpha` allows us to set the transparency
```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       aes(x = carat, y= price))+
  {{geom_point(alpha = .05)}}
```

This is where we could change the point color with `colour = "red"`

We could change the marker type `shape = 5`

]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width=500, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       aes(x = carat, y= price))+
  {{geom_point(alpha = .05)}}
```
]

---
# Now We Can Add a Statistic

.pull-left[
```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, 
             aes(x = carat, y= price))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05)+
  {{geom_smooth(method = "lm")}} # Our Statistic
```

In this case we are using a linear model, but other models can be used:

- Generalised linear models (logistic regression, poisson regression)

- LOESS

- GAMs

]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width=500, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

# Modify the Scales with `scale_`

.pull-left[
```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
p <- p+
  {{scale_y_log10()}}+ # Scale for the Y-axis
  {{scale_x_log10()}} # Scale for X-axis

```

Through scale arguments we can change
- Other transformations like square root transformation
- Other "scales" like percents, discrete data, or dates
- Break points (e.g. what labels appear)
- Limits
- Control colours and some other properties

]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width=500, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
p
```

]
---

# We Can Introduce Facets

```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
(p<- p+
  {{facet_wrap(~cut)}} # Facet by "cut"
 )
```

---

# Now we can add some descriptors

.pull-left[
```{r out.height=300, fig.align='center'}
p <- p +
  {{labs(
    title = "There is Higher Variability in Price for Fair Diamonds",
    subtitle = "Log-Log Plot of Carat vs Price",
    caption = "Data: Diamonds Dataset",
    y = "Log Price ($)",
    x = "Log Carat"
  )}}
```

As you add additional aesthetics you can change the description in the `labs` arguments (e.g. if you added a colour aesthetic you could rename it here)

# We can change the theme and a few details

There are many default themes, but checkout [ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes)

```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
p <- p+
  {{theme_minimal()}}
```

library(ggthemes)
p+
  {{theme_stata()}}
```
]

---
# Or Customise Even Further

.pull-left[
You can change _every_ element of the graph

```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
p <- p+
  theme(panel.grid = 
          element_blank(),
        plot.title = 
          element_text(size = 20),
        strip.background = 
          element_rect(fill = "#F0F0F0"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
p

# Add Another Aesthetic

.pull-left[
```{r out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
p<- p +
  {{aes(color = clarity)}}+
  labs(color = "Clarity")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width=500, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
p
```

]


---

# And they layer and can be saved

You can layer additional components until you complete your message.

But...now you may want to save your image.

`ggave` has this functionality

Can save to pdf or png and specify the dimensions

```{r eval=FALSE}
p %>% 
  ggsave(filename = "outputs/my_cool_plot.pdf")
```

# Making More Complex Graphics

`ggplot2` has been extended in many [ways](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/)

- Stitch plots together with `cowplot`

- Add GIS capabilities with `sf`

- Network analysis with `ggraph`

- interactive graphics with `plotly`

---

# Interactivity with `plotly2`

.pull-left[

The `plotly` library allows you to make interactive graphs with `ggplot2` objects.

These are great features on websites.

```{r eval=FALSE}
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, 
             aes(disp, mpg, 
                 color= as.factor(cyl)))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(
    title = "My plotly object",
    color = "Cylinders"
  )+
  theme_fivethirtyeight()

library(plotly)
ggplotly(p2)

```

]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg, color= as.factor(cyl)))+

  labs(

library(plotly)
ggplotly(p2)
```

# Recap

`ggplot2` is an implmentation of the _Grammar of Graphics_

It allows us to make publication quality graphics by mapping data to aesthetics via geometries and statistics.
